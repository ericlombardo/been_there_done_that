  "Drove all day without rain... until I got to the campsite. Rained the entire trip and wasn't able to do what we came to do. Still had a good time spending quality time in the tent. Got a lot of reading done and looking forward to getting back outside on the next trip. Definetly think that this is the best place that I have been so far and want to come back once the weather is nicer.", "This place is filled with places to explore. Everywhere you look there seems to be another path to follow. Have seen a lot of wildlife and done some decent climbing on this trip. Tracking it all in my journal so that we know what we have done and what we need to do next trip here. Definetly will be back to this place so we can experience everything that it has to offer.", "SAW A BEAR!!! That was definelty a first. Was walking through the woods minding my own business when something caught my attention. I didn't think anything of it until I looked up and saw a bear coming my way. I slowly backed away and headed back to camp. Some people think that seeing a bear out in wildlife is natural and cool. Having experienced it I can honostly say, not my cup of tea.", "Got to the campsite and unpacked. There is definelty a charm about the site. There are people all over all trying to take in the great outdoors. Went on a small hike after set up, but turned back around due to me not feeling well. Went back and cooked dinner. Felt better the next morning and was able to hike a mountain on an empty stomach. Not something I would recommend", "Did some of the best fishing that I have ever done. Usually I don't catch much because I am not an avid fisher. The fish were definelty bitting and I was able to catch a wopping 32 fish. I was also proud of the fact that none of the fish swallowed the hook and I was able to release all of them back into the water. This is definetly my go to fishing spot for future trips that I take", "Super cold trip. wasn't really able to enjoy outside because it was so cold. I tried to venture out to do some exploring, but I ended up slipping on ice and falling with my camera. I think everything is ok, but I will wait and see if the images are distored or anything. Warmed up by the fire and had a nice night of relaxation and reading. Made a cup of tea to sooth my aches.", "Everything went wrong and I still had a good time. Missed the enterance to the park, drove for hours to retrace my steps, went on the wrong trail, it rained, and I couldn't get any firewood. There was still a peace of mind that came with the trip that I was able to enjoy. It reminded me that there may be a plan that we have, but even if it doesn't go our way, we can still have a good time and enjoy the great outdoors.", "We drove to the site and set up. It was a little later than we thought, but we set up quickly. When we woke up we were able to get the day started with some food. It was a nice time just spending some time relaxing. That night when back from the days adventure we started a fire and cooked dinner. It was a great trip that will be a highlight for many years to come.", "Our first flight was late and we missed our connecting flight to Florida. After the rough start things picked up a little. We were comped a night at the hotel and were able to get a good night sleep. Once arriving in Florida we spent the whole time outside. Happy to report that the flights home went much smoother", "Hiked all day every day for the past week. My friend and I had a lot of great conversations and made memories that will last a lifetime. There were some tense moments as there always are, but that makes the good moments even better", "Was able to do a lot of thinking on this trip. Thought about how God made all of nature and we are blessed to be able to enjoy it. This trip really made me appreciate the parks that are available to hike and take adventures in."]
